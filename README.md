HackDuke 2016: Code for Good Energy
This is a bootstrap website I made for HackDuke 2016. The mission of the hackathon was to code for good, so my website is intended to promote environmental awareness. There's information to read about relevant news and ways that you can contribute to the environment straight from your computer. The repository was remade on March 10th.
